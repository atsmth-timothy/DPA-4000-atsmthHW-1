# Assignment: Practicing Basic Shell Commands and GitHub

#### Objective

In this assignment, you will practice using basic Linux shell commands and GitHub to create, edit, and share files. Youâ€™ll also learn how to add descriptions, links, and images to your GitHub repository. This should be straightfoward - just setting up your pipeline.

## Part 1: Shell Practice

- Open the README.md `pico README.md` and answer the questions. Use `cat README.md` and take a screenshot of your terminal showing this output.
- Create a Directory: Open your terminal. Create a new directory called assignment1 using the command: `mkdir assignment1`
- Inside this directory, create three empty files: `file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`
- List Files with Details. Run the following command: `ls -ltra`. Take a screenshot of your terminal showing this output, save it for later. Call it `part1a.jpg`

## Part 2: GitHub Practice
- Clone this repository into your local machine, make the changes from part 1.
- `commit` and `push` the changes back to GitHub.
- Add three different links and some text describing them in markdown into the README file.
- Add some bolding and itlacs text.
- Add one extra image of your own art work or something related to Clemson (e.g., a picture of the campus, mascot, or Tiger Paw).


This project confirms you have setup Git correctly and understand how to turn in all future assignments.
